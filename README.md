## 🚀 About Me

Aspiring **Cloud & DevOps** engineer with a strong foundation in AWS, Azure, Linux, and containerized deployments.  
Enjoys understanding how systems work end to end and turning that into reliable, automated cloud solutions.  

Previously worked as an Electronics Hardware Engineer, testing and bringing up PCBs and electronic equipment with a focus on quality, safety, and repeatable test processes.  
Hands-on debugging and measurement experience now helps in designing practical, production-ready infrastructure.  

Currently building projects around cloud, DevOps, Kubernetes, and Generative AI for cloud/DevOps use cases, aiming to contribute to scalable, high-impact systems.
